## About

* The goal of this webpage is to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria.
A new, secured password must be generated.
If the button is clicked, it generates a password and the user is shown prompts for the password criteria.
The criteria is "special, numeric, upper, lower".
At least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters are allowed, so the arrow keys allow for a certain amount.
Another requirement is, it should be validated and at least one character type should be selected in the box.
All prompts are answered according to whatever is selected.
When the user generates the password, it is written to the page.

## About Nuxeo

Nuxeo Platform is an open source Content Services platform, written in Java. Data can be stored in both SQL & NoSQL databases.

The development of the Nuxeo Platform is mostly done by Nuxeo employees with an open development model.

The source code, documentation, roadmap, issue tracker, testing, benchmarks are all public.

Typically, Nuxeo users build different types of information management solutions for [document management](https://www.nuxeo.com/solutions/document-management/), [case management](https://www.nuxeo.com/solutions/case-management/), and [digital asset management](https://www.nuxeo.com/solutions/dam-digital-asset-management/), use cases. It uses schema-flexible metadata & content models that allows content to be repurposed to fulfill future use cases.
